Create the foundational storage interface and project structure for the Earlybird SDK storage layer.

## Description
This issue implements the core \`StorageAdapter\` interface that will be used by all storage implementations. This is the foundational piece that all other storage work depends on.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create directory structure in \`packages/core/src/storage/\`
- [ ] Implement \`StorageAdapter\` interface with full TypeScript definitions
- [ ] Define storage error types and enums
- [ ] Export interface from package index
- [ ] Set up basic Jest configuration for storage tests
- [ ] Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] \`StorageAdapter\` interface defined with all required methods:
  - \`read(path: string): Promise<string | null>\`
  - \`write(path: string, content: string): Promise<void>\`
  - \`delete(path: string): Promise<void>\`
  - \`exists(path: string): Promise<boolean>\`
  - \`list(directory: string): Promise<string[]>\`
- [ ] Error types defined and exported (\`StorageError\`, \`FileNotFoundError\`, etc.)
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] Directory structure matches architectural plan
- [ ] Interface is properly exported from package
- [ ] JSDoc documentation covers all methods and error cases

## Files to Create/Modify
- \`packages/core/src/storage/interfaces/StorageAdapter.ts\`

  --body "## Summary
Implement the Capacitor filesystem storage adapter for mobile and web platforms.

## Description
Create a production-ready implementation of the \`StorageAdapter\` interface using Capacitor's Filesystem API. This adapter will handle file operations across iOS, Android, and web platforms.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement \`CapacitorStorageAdapter\` class using Capacitor Filesystem
- [ ] Add Capacitor dependencies to package.json
- [ ] Handle platform-specific file operations
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and path resolution
- [ ] Add support for directory operations
- [ ] Handle file encoding/decoding
- [ ] Create unit tests with Capacitor API mocking
- [ ] Add cross-platform path normalization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All \`StorageAdapter\` methods implemented correctly
- [ ] Capacitor Filesystem integration working properly
- [ ] Cross-platform path handling (iOS/Android/Web)
- [ ] Proper error mapping from Capacitor errors to our error types
- [ ] Unit tests with mocked Capacitor APIs (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (<100ms for small files)
- [ ] Directory creation when needed
- [ ] Path sanitization for different platforms
- [ ] Proper file encoding/decoding handling
- [ ] Graceful handling of permission errors

## Files to Create/Modify
- \`packages/core/src/storage/adapters/CapacitorStorageAdapter.ts\`
- \`packages/core/tests/storage/adapters/CapacitorStorageAdapter.test.ts\`

  --body "## Summary
Create a comprehensive shared test suite that validates any StorageAdapter implementation.

## Description
Build a reusable test suite that can validate any implementation of the \`StorageAdapter\` interface. This ensures all adapters behave consistently and meet the interface contract.

## Tasks

  - Error scenarios (file not found, invalid paths)
- [ ] Edge cases covered:
  - Invalid paths and special characters
  - Large files (up to 10MB)
