### Package Management
- [ ] **Add LICENSE file** - Choose and include appropriate license
- [ ] **Update README files** - Improve package-level documentation
- [ ] **Add CHANGELOG.md** - Document version history and changes
- [ ] **Setup semantic versioning** - Implement proper version management
- [ ] **Add npm ignore files** - Exclude unnecessary files from packages

## üîß Critical Improvements (Beta Release - 4-6 weeks)

- [ ] **Bundle size optimization** - Minimize package size for web usage

### API Documentation
- [ ] **Generate API docs** - Use TypeDoc or similar for comprehensive API reference
- [ ] **Write usage guides** - Step-by-step guides for common use cases
- [ ] **Add code examples** - Real-world examples for each major feature
- [ ] **Document storage adapters** - Guide for creating custom adapters
- [ ] **Document sync protocol** - Technical details of synchronization process

### Development Tooling
