# Issue #6 Implementation Plan - Storage Foundation & Interface

## Completed Steps ✅

### Step 1: Directory Structure Setup
- Created `src/storage/` directory structure
- Simplified to flat structure (Option A) following "simplicity over pinache" principle

### Step 2: Storage Error Types Definition  
- Implemented `StorageError` class with minimal error codes
- Created `StorageErrorCode` enum with `NOT_FOUND` and `OPERATION_FAILED`
- Added static factory methods for convenient error creation

### Step 3: StorageAdapter Interface Implementation
- Created `StorageAdapter` interface with all 5 required methods
- Added comprehensive TypeScript types and JSDoc documentation
- Implemented clean async API suitable for all storage backends

### Step 4: Package Exports Setup
- Created `src/storage/index.ts` to export interface and errors
- Set up `src/index.ts` as main entry point
- Updated root `index.ts` to import from src structure

### Step 5: Bun Test Configuration ✅
- Added test scripts to `package.json` using Bun.test (minimal dependencies)
- Created comprehensive test structure in `tests/` directory  
- Implemented consolidated tests for exports and error functionality
- Simplified from 4 test files to 1 test file, removing redundancy
- Added test coverage reporting by default
- All tests passing with 100% coverage ✅

### Step 6: TypeScript Compilation Verification ✅
- Verified new `src/` structure compiles correctly ✅
- Tested exports work properly at runtime ✅ 
- All path references working correctly ✅

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

All steps have been successfully implemented. The storage foundation is ready for use.
