- Large files for performance testing
- Binary data handling
- Special characters and unicode
- Nested directory structures

## Performance Requirements

### InMemoryStorageAdapter
- Operations should complete in < 1ms for small files
- Memory usage should be predictable
- Support for files up to 10MB without performance degradation

### CapacitorStorageAdapter
- File operations should complete in < 100ms for small files
- Graceful handling of device storage limitations
- Proper error reporting for storage issues

## Definition of Done

### Core Implementation
- [ ] `StorageAdapter` interface implemented with full documentation
- [ ] `InMemoryStorageAdapter` passes all shared tests
- [ ] `CapacitorStorageAdapter` passes all shared tests
- [ ] Both adapters implement all interface methods correctly

### Testing
- [ ] Shared test suite covers all interface methods
- [ ] Adapter-specific tests validate unique behaviors
- [ ] Integration tests confirm interface compliance
- [ ] Test coverage >= 95% for all storage code
- [ ] All tests pass in CI environment

### Documentation

- [ ] All tests pass consistently
- [ ] No memory leaks in test suites
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements

## Risk Mitigation

### Capacitor Integration Risks
- **Risk**: Capacitor API changes or compatibility issues
- **Mitigation**: Pin Capacitor version, create adapter wrapper for API changes

### Cross-Platform File System Differences
- **Risk**: Path handling differences between iOS/Android/Web
- **Mitigation**: Implement robust path normalization, comprehensive platform testing

### Testing in Different Environments
- **Risk**: Tests may behave differently in different environments
- **Mitigation**: Use Jest environment configuration, mock external dependencies consistently

## Success Metrics

1. **Functionality**: All CRUD operations work correctly on both adapters
2. **Reliability**: Test suite passes consistently across multiple runs
3. **Performance**: Meets defined performance requirements
4. **Maintainability**: Code is well-documented and follows established patterns
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new storage adapters following the same pattern

This foundation will enable Phase 2's CRDT Store implementation by providing a reliable, tested, and well-documented storage layer that abstracts away platform-specific details while maintaining high performance and reliability.
